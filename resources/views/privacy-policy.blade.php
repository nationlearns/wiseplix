                                                    to access Wise Plix services, which helps us provide features like

                                                    information when a Wise Plix service on your device contacts our
                                                    servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store
                                                    or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an

                                                    depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you
                                                    can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s

                                                    create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices.

                                                    from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears
                                                    in your local newspaper, Wise Plix ’s Search engine may index that

                                                <p>
                                                    Wise Plix works with businesses and organizations in a variety of
                                                    ways. We refer to these businesses and organizations as “partners”.
                                                    For example, non-Wise Plix websites and apps partner with Wise Plix
                                                    to show ads. .Other partners help Wise Plix with securing our
                                                    services; information about security threats can help us notify you
                                                    if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can
                                                    help you take steps to protect your account). Note we also work with
                                                    trusted businesses as “data processors” rather than partners,
                                                    meaning they process information on our behalf, to support our
                                                    services, based on our instructions and in compliance with our

                                                    measures. The Wise Plix Privacy Policy has more information about
                                                    how we use data processors. We don’t share information that
                                                    personally identifies you with our advertising partners, such as
                                                    your name or email, unless you ask us to share it. For example, if
                                                    you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call
                                                    or connect” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone
